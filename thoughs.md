## Idea 1 - Alley Cat Reversed

The old DOS game, but you don't play as the cat, but as the grumpy old guy throwing stuff at the cat to scare him away

Challenges:

- How to throw things in AFrame with physics.
- Make the game look like the original in VR.

## Idea 2 - COD: Black CAT

Some sort of shooter in the style of COD and Rainbow Siege. You play as the Special Ops Black CAT and need to fight against mice in a house.

Challenges:

- Creating an interesting level. Walls are doable, but the house needs to be filled with furniture.
- Cute cat paws instead of controllers. How to hold a gun?
- How to detect shooting when a chair is in the way?
- Enemy AI?

Maybe mice can run from mousehole to mousecehole.

## Idea 3 - Rooftop Run

Parcour like endless runner. You play as a black cat running on the rooftops and jumping from one to the next.

- How to keep this interesting?
- How to make it about a black cat?
