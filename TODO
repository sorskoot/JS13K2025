Voxel Engine:
    Decisions to make:
        ✔ Figure out how large the world should be @done(25-09-01 22:32)
        ✔ Are the walls going to be voxels too? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Materials or colors? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Do we keep the raytracing? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Lighting? @done(25-09-05 21:03)

    Level:
        ✔ Better way to generate levels @done(25-09-06 21:50)
        ☐ Design a level
        ☐ Spawning mice at holes
        ☐ Colliding with walls need to be beter.
