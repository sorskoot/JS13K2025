Voxel Engine:
    Decisions to make:
        ✔ Figure out how large the world should be @done(25-09-01 22:32)
        ✔ Are the walls going to be voxels too? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Materials or colors? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Do we keep the raytracing? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Lighting? @done(25-09-05 21:03)

Must Have:
    Mice:
        ~ The spawn at the mouse holes.
        ✔ Moving Mice @done(25-09-11 15:26)
        ✔ Attacking Mice @done(25-09-11 15:26)

    Cheese-bomb:
        ☐ Explodes 10 mintes after the game starts
    Win state:
        ☐ touch the cheese-bomb for 5 seconds
    Lose state:
        ☐ Run out of lives (9)
        ☐ Run out of time (10 minutes)
    ☐ Bites. When a mouse bites you, you lose a life. After biting the mouse runs away.
    ✔ Shoot Mice @done(25-09-11 22:32)
    ☐ Block Mouseholes
    Level:
        ✔ Better way to generate levels @done(25-09-06 21:50)
        ✔ Design a level @done(25-09-10 15:35)
        ✔ Spawning mice at holes @done(25-09-10 15:35)
        ☐ Colliding with walls need to be beter.
            ~ Right now you stay too far off the walls
    ☐ A global function that returns the room number based on position.

Should Have:
    ☐ Crappy audio (is better then no audio)
    ☐ Red flash when bitten (make a red light)

Could Have:
    ☐ post processing effects (SSAO, Bloom)

Would like:
    ☐ Randomized levels
