# TODO

Voxel Engine:
    Decisions to make:
        ✔ Figure out how large the world should be @done(25-09-01 22:32)
        ✔ Are the walls going to be voxels too? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Materials or colors? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Do we keep the raytracing? @done(25-09-05 21:03)
        ✔ Lighting? @done(25-09-05 21:03)

Before Release:
    ☐ Write desciption of the game
    ☐ Create artwork

Must Have:
    Mice:
        ~ The spawn at the mouse holes.
        ✔ Moving Mice @done(25-09-11 15:26)
        ✔ Attacking Mice @done(25-09-11 15:26)
        ✔ Hiding Mice @done(25-09-11 15:26)
    Cheese-bomb:
        ✔ Explodes 10 mintes after the game starts @done(25-09-12 17:41)
    Win state:
        ✔ touch the cheese-bomb @done(25-09-12 17:41)
    Lose state:
        ☐ Run out of lives (9)
        ✔ Run out of time (10 minutes) @done(25-09-12 17:41)
    ☐ Bites. When a mouse bites you, you lose a life.
        ✔ After biting the mouse runs away. @done(25-09-12 17:42)
    ✔ Shoot Mice @done(25-09-11 22:32)
    ✔ Block Mouseholes @done(25-09-12 15:24)
    Level:
        ☐ Finish the level design - Add mouse holes
        ✔ Better way to generate levels @done(25-09-06 21:50)
        ✔ Design a level @done(25-09-10 15:35)
        ✔ Spawning mice at holes @done(25-09-10 15:35)
        ✔ Colliding with walls need to be beter. @done(25-09-12 00:25)
            ~ Right now you stay too far off the walls
    ☐ A global function that returns the room number based on position.
        ☐ Activate mouseholes in adjacent rooms based on this.

Should Have:
    ☐ Title Screen
    ☐ Game Over Screen
    ☐ Some indication of time left every now and then
        Just a text in your face that says "5 minutes left" etc.
    ☐ Add furniture
    ☐ Add more lights (automatically per room)
        if too much, enable them similar to the mouseholes
    ☐ Touch the bomb for 5 seconds to win
    ☐ Be able to restart the game without refresh
    ☐ Crappy audio (is better then no audio)
    ☐ Red flash when bitten (make a red light)
    ☐ Show amount of lives left

Could Have:
    ☐ post processing effects (SSAO, Bloom)
    ☐ different floors
    ☐ Destructible environments, like doors that block rooms
    ☐ Make mice attack faster and pathfind to you, beyond rooms and line of sight.
    ☐ On top of that, add sneak mode to avoid detections, until line of sight.

Would like:
    ☐ Randomized levels
